      "Yes, in a way, everything kind of is pointless, and nothing really matters. But we are here... aren't we? And while we're at it, let's be sure to make sure that we make the best of it. What else is there? Besides, dying, of course.) Yes, it seems a bit too far-fetched, but it is what it is... This is where you end up when you're desperately trying to find some solid ground to stand on because we do not go gentle into that good night...We try to enjoy our shared existence together. We try to enjoy the rain, the summer, the spring, the autumn, the winter, the flowers, the views, the human emotions, being with the ones we love, and caring for them through all the uncertainties of life, and for as long as we possibly can. That's life...Nothing matters in the end, and still, we're somehow alive, here. So, we try to live, we try to move on, we try to hold on, we try to just be, you know... here, in this moment. We at least try. And we try, and we try... we fall, we get up, and we try...In a way, change is, in fact, a fundamental signature of life. Life is change. Life is dynamic. It is that very dynamic pattern of life that makes our existence possible in the first place. So, in the end, the dynamic pattern, i.e., you, must dissolve for the sake of the continuance of the flow permanence that we understand as this strange little life. Just a dream of a dream...Nothing lasts forever. Everything changes, for better or for worse, and life goes on. Life always goes on, and no one knows why...",

      "it's a vibe. i personally love the Blade Runner 2049 soundtrack album. Interstellar sits right beside. Going into a night that seems endless... just thinking, wondering, existing... everything just starts to makes sense in a way that doesn't usually... just living somewhere, moving through time and space, headed towards a future that's uncertain and unknown. Going round and round on a planet that itself moves round and round with no destination in particular that it itself exists inside a galaxy as a mere speck of dust whose vastness is beyond comprehension and who also happpens to move round and round in itself without a purpose... as what it seems to me as just a mare byproduct of entropy in a universe that is constantly expanding into what we have no clue... everything becomes pointless at this point... the only thing that makes sense is that we exist in time i.e., right now until, we don't. For reasons we don't understand, and the concept of time is just... damn. So, in despair, we shall die...",
